Surely you've come across web applications where you scroll down,
and it scrolls horizontally. 
In this article, we will implement this feature using JavaScript and in React.

# JavaScript version

Let's say we have two `div` blocks on the page, 
each filling the entire screen, 
and they are positioned on the same horizontal axis within a given `container`.

<CodeBlock path="./index.html" client:load>
```html

<div class="container">
  <div class="page page-1"></div>
  <div class="page page-2"></div>
</div>
```
</CodeBlock>


And we want the page to scroll horizontally 
when the user performs a standard vertical scroll. 
To achieve this, we first set `overflow-x: scroll` on the container 
to make it horizontally scrollable. 
Then, we are going to listen for `wheel` event on our container, 
which triggers when the user scrolls using a mouse or trackpad.

<CodeBlock path="./index.js" client:load>
```javascript

const container = document.querySelector('.container')

container.addEventListener('wheel', (event) => {
  // your code goes here
})
```
</CodeBlock>

Now we need to determine in which direction the user is scrolling, 
as the wheel event triggers for both vertical and horizontal scrolling. 
To do this, we use two properties of the event object: deltaX and deltaY. 
deltaX represents the amount of horizontal scrolling, 
and deltaY represents the amount of vertical scrolling.

We will update the scrollLeft property of the container, 
which is responsible for horizontal scrolling. 
Note that deltaX and deltaY can be both positive and negative. 
For example, if deltaY has a negative value, the user is scrolling down, 
and if it has a positive value, the user is scrolling up. 
The scrollLeft property works similarly: if it's positive, 
it scrolls to the left, and if it's negative, it scrolls to the right.

<CodeBlock path="./index.js" client:load>
```javascript

const container = document.querySelector('.container')

container.addEventListener('wheel', (event) => {
  event.preventDefault()

  container.scrollLeft += e.deltaY
  container.scrollLeft += e.deltaX
})
```
</CodeBlock>
